# LPOO_52 - LikeRogue

LikeRogue was based on the 1980 classic Rogue when it comes to the dungeon crawling aspect and much of the turn based battle inspired by Pokémon in its.
For this project we chose to implement a simple Roguelike Dungeon Crawler. This project, aptly named "LikeRogue", draws a lot of inspiration from the 1980 classic Rogue, as well as from the Pokemon Series.

In LikeRogue you're a young hero tasked with venturing into the depths of a dungeon close to your village, defeating all the monsters which lie within in the process.
The Game is split into two primary sections:
A portion of the Game consists of a dungeon crawler segment, wherein the player traverses a dungeon with some procedurally generated elements, in a way very reminiscent of the Game which named this project, until he comes into contact with an enemy, thus entering the battle phase.
During this phase, the Game turns into a turn based battle between the player and the enemies, very much akin to pokemon's battle system. The player may opt to attack with its standard attack, use a magic spell, or use one item he has previously picked up.

This project was developed by Diogo Pereira (up201906422@edu.fe.up.pt), Joana Mesquita (up201907878@edu.fe.up.pt) and Mário Travassos (up201905871@edu.fe.up.pt) for the LPOO class of 2020⁄21.
